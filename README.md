# CS2050
Most of my homework assignments and labs from CS2050: Algorithm Design and Programming II at Mizzou in Spring 2016. 

(I forgot to save my last few labs and last two homeworks from the server.) 

All code is in C. The course description: "A study of fundamental techniques and algorithms for representing and manipulating data structures. Topics include data abstraction, recursion, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, efficient methods of sorting and searching, and Big-O analysis."
