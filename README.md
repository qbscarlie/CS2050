# CS2050
All my homework assignments and labs from CS2050: Algorithm Design and Programming II at Mizzou in Spring 2016. 

All code is in C. The course description: "A study of fundamental techniques and algorithms for representing and manipulating data structures. Topics include data abstraction, recursion, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, efficient methods of sorting and searching, and Big-O analysis."
