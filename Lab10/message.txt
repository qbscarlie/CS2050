Hello!

	This is a test message for your lab. I hope you can handle things like phone numbers (324)787-9892 and dates 03/14/2016. Make sure the period at the end of that last sentence didn't trip you up. If you have anytrouble feel free to email me at 2050@missouri.com but not 2050@missouri.edu. We are available to help anytime on 02/30/1997 if you can make it.

All the best!

Seth Wiesman
